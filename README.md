# ITMD441_Lab-3
JavaScript code with basic syntax

Introduction
This lab will have you write some JavaScript code using basic syntax and built-in functionality.
Requirements
    • For each prompt below create a separate .js file that includes your code. We should be
    able to copy your code and paste it in the browser console to see it run as demonstrated
    in class.
    • Name each file with this pattern: userId-lab3-1.js
    • Your code should have the required functions or data objects and an invocation of the
    code that tests and shows console output.
    • Use the basic syntax and language features discussed in class and any of the standard
    DOM API functions (browser).
    • Test each solution and provide a line that runs your code and shows the output in the
    console. Examples were shown in class. Use console.log() for this.
    • Zip all of your separate .js files into a single zip file and submit it to the assignment in
    Canvas.
    
## Exercise 1
    o Write a function named `minMaxAverage` that takes an array of numbers as the
    only parameter and outputs the following string to the browser console when
    run.
    o “Total Numbers: xx, Min Value: xx, Max Value: xx, Average: xx”
    o Invoke the function with the following array as a test value.
    o [2, 5, 23, 6, 9, 4, 30, 1]
    o Test your function with different inputs and output at least one additional test
    value
## Exercise 2
    o Write a function named `countVowels` that takes a string as input parameter
    and returns the number of vowels in the string.
    o For this exercise vowels are ‘a e i o u’ we won’t count ‘y’
    o Use console.log and invocations your countVowels function to print three test
    words to the console. Each test line should output the word and then a number
    of vowels. “word: x vowels”
## Exercise 3
    o Write a function named `sortNumbers` that takes an array of numbers as the
    only parameter and returns the array sorted from smallest to largest.
    o Use console.log and invocations your sortNumbers function to print three test
    arrays of your choice to the console. Each test line should output to the console
    the original array and the sorted array.
    o Original Array: [x, x, x, x]
    Sorted Array: [x , x, x, x]
## Exercise 4
    o Create a function called `celsiusToFahrenheit` that takes a temperature in
    Celsius as a number parameter and converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula F
    = (C * 9/5) + 32.
    o Use console.log and invocations your function to print three test values of your
    choice to the console. Each test line should output to the console log both the
    Celsius and Fahrenheit values to the console.
    o Make sure log output always shows only one decimal place.
    o “xx.x Celsius = xx.x Fahrenheit”
# Graduate Additional Requirements
If you are involved in any section of 541 you need to complete the additional requirements
listed here.
Graduate students will be graded to a higher standard for this assignment.
Graduate students also have to do the following:
    • Make Exercise 4 also work if the user passes a string value of a number instead of an
    actual number value. Output 2 additional tests with string values.
## Exercise 5
    o Create a function that takes an array of objects representing people (with
    properties like name, age, and city). The function should sort the people objects
    by age going from youngest to oldest and return a new array of strings
    introducing the people in the sorted order.
    o An introduction string should be formatted like: “name is age and from city”
    o Use console.log and invocations your function to print two test input/outputs of
    your choice to the console. Your test arrays should contain at least 5 objects.
    o The people object should follow this structure
    o {name: ‘Name’, age: 23, city: ‘Chicago’}

Due Date
This assignment is due Sunday October 12, 2025, 11:59 PM Chicago Time. No Extensions or
Exceptions. Late policy in syllabus applies. We will discuss this in the next class so no
assignments will be accepted after class starts the week after week.

Submission Guidelines
You must upload your submission, to the canvas assignment by the due date. The submission
must be in the following format and structure. If you do not submit your assignment exactly as
specified, you will receive an immediate 10% deduction.

Submission Specifications
Submit to the canvas assignment a zip file containing your separate JS files for each exercise.
You should expect us to copy what is in your file, paste it in the browser console, run it and see
the output. Any deviation from that will not get full points.
